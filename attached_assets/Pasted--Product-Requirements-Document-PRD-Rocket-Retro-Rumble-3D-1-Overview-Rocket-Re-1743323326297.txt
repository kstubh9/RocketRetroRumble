# Rocket Retro Rumble 3D

## 1. Overview

**Rocket Retro Rumble 3D** is a high-speed, chaotic, retro-styled 3D rocket racing game. Players navigate dynamically generated tracks filled with hazards, power-ups, and unpredictable terrain using full 3D flight mechanics. The game blends pixelated aesthetics with modern physics-driven movement for a unique racing experience.

## 2. Core Features

### **Rocket Control**

- Full 3D movement: Thrust (forward/backward), pitch (up/down), yaw (left/right), and optional roll.
- Physics-driven handling for a more engaging flight experience.
- Boost mechanics for sudden bursts of speed.

### **Chaotic Track Generation**

- Procedurally generated tracks featuring twists, vertical climbs, corkscrews, and track gaps.
- Environmental hazards like:
  - **Asteroid Fields** – Dodge moving obstacles.
  - **Energy Gates** – Grant speed boosts or cause temporary malfunctions.
  - **Turbulence Zones** – Alter handling and visual effects.
  - **Gravity Anomalies** – Reverse or shift gravity forces.

### **Power-Ups**

- **Boost Blast** – Instant acceleration.
- **Temporary Shield** – Protection from hazards.
- **EMP Pulse** – Disrupts controls of nearby opponents (if multiplayer is included).
- **Gravity Flip** – Alters gravity temporarily.
- **Pixel Rain** – Obscures vision of competitors.

### **Visuals & Effects**

- **Volumetric Pixel Rockets** – Rockets built from 3D cubes for a distinct retro aesthetic.
- **Dynamic Camera Angles** – Chase cam, cockpit view, and dynamic tracking.
- **Particle Effects** – Used for rocket trails, explosions, power-ups, and hazards.
- **Screen Shake & Visual Distortion** – Enhances immersion during intense moments.

### **Advertising & Sponsorships**

- In-game **billboards, flyers, and banners** on tracks for potential sponsorships.
- Customizable advertisements integrated seamlessly into the environment.

## 3. Technical Requirements

- **Engine:** Three.js for 3D graphics and physics simulation.
- **Procedural Generation:** Algorithm for track creation ensuring variety and replayability.
- **Physics Handling:** Smooth, responsive flight mechanics with realistic acceleration and drag.
- **Multiplayer Consideration:** If implemented, requires real-time networking and latency handling.

## 4. Monetization & Business Model

- Free-to-play with optional ad placements via track-side billboards.
- Potential sponsorship deals for in-game brand placements.



## 5. Next Steps

1. Implement **basic rocket movement** with physics-based thrust and rotation.
2. Develop **procedural track generation** with environmental hazards.
3. Integrate **volumetric pixel-based rocket models**.
4. Design **visual effects, dynamic cameras, and environmental interactions**.
5. Implement **billboard and advertisement mechanics** for potential sponsorships.
